# To-Do-List
To Do App to demonstrate skills learned in Javascript to date.

This App will allow the user to add different task to a To-Do List. The tasks will each include information such as the task title, a brief description, the due date, priority and a checkbox. the user may also add notes to the task to update how it is going.


Properties a todo item should have:

- Title
- Description
- Due Date / Time
- Priority
- Done
- Notes
- Project

App should have standard todo list with all todos.
User should also have option to make own projects to separate out lists (create new object for each list but show all object items in main list)

(Possible goal is to allow list of different app users and assign the task to one of them via a drop down).

The app will also allow the user to create different projects and to group together different tasks. All of these tasks should be viewable from the main list however.

Tasks to be completed today or this week should be in their own separate groupings.


There should be a filter by owner button to see all tasks done by that individual and those outstanding

If task is complete and out of date remove from list

if task is not complete and out of date highlight in red
